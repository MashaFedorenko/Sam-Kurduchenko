	<img src="images/my-Sam.jpg" alt="This grey cat with camomille flowers is my lovely Sam">

	<p>This is the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" title="For those who still don't know what does cat mean" target="_blank">cat</a> I've ever seen</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Species: Cat</li>
		<li>Name: Sam</li>
		<li>Sex: Male</li>
		<li>Age: 1 year</li>
		<li>Fur-color: Grey</li>
		<li>Eye-color: Green</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you want me to describe <strong>how much</strong> I love this small grey furry ass I will not be able. Because like no one's mind can understand what does the infinity mean, <em>no one is able to realize</em> the strength of my tenderness, joy and the rest my best feelings and emotions caused by this <strong>little pretty gentleman</strong>. The only thing is missing with him is that he still <em>has no younger sister</em>. But we are currently working for this dream, my, Sam's and I believe Bohdan's too, become real!</p>

	<p>P.S.: By the way, this is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXbk8IaNYC6/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=" title="Tiny boy" target="_blank"><em>the photo</em></a> of Sam's being 6-month old kitten, which melted our hearts and forced us to adopt him that beautiful grumpy day on the 19th of December 2021.</p>
